TODO:

1. Create basic app for contract deployment - DONE
2. Write basic contract for tokens (and use it in real wallets) - DONE
3. Migrate to endpoints
4. Add swagger
5. Integrate database
6. Add authorization

INVESTIGATE:

1. investigate infura expiration flow
2. think about difference between smart contracts and tokens flow:
   instant transaction(only token flow) / transaction after DOD (contract + token)
3. investigate 18 decimals problem: what is this feature for, when to use it and when not
4. provider usage issue: - transfer eth to corporate account and then proceed transactions? - find ways to use it directly from user accound (without mnemonics) - maybe self-created and supported ETHEREUM NODE!!!
5. Gas and etc. optimization
